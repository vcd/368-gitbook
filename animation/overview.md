# Overview

## CSS Animation

CSS Animation encompasses three concepts:

* Transform
* Transition
* Keyframe Animation

### Overview

Pros

* Animates CSS properties that have a numerical value
* Widely supported by browsers, platforms, and devices
* [Better performance with fewer re-_paints_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvu6_j8Qzfk)\_\_
* No required plugins like Adobe Flash or dependencies e.g. JavaScript Animation Libraries 
* Degrades gracefully if not browser not supported

Cons

* Requires JavaScript for `click` events or other non-CSS events
* Cumbersome to write complex “multi-scene” animations e.g. different timing and delays
* No standard timeline, scrubber, or other Adobe _After Effects_
